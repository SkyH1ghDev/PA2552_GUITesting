\section{Discussion}

My test suite is based on testing the functionality and usage of the Godot foundations webpage for the Godot Game Engine.
The reasoning behind this decision was partially due to the fact that I am studying a game engine focused programme, and
partially because it is easy to reason about the different requirements of an open source development project.

In the table below, I will describe and explain why I chose these specific features for my suite and why they may be of use
